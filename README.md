# Major-Project_Power-Efficient-CMOS-Dynamic-Latch-Comparators-for-ADCs
# Abstract
In today's digital age, Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) are vital components, converting 
analog signals into digital format. The Comparator, a key element in ADC design, 
accomplishes this conversion by comparing the analog signal with a stable reference signal, 
resulting in a digital output (High or Low). This project focuses on designing and evaluating a 
comparator with minimal power usage. The analysis includes four different comparator 
architectures: Single Tail Dynamic Latch, Double-Tail Dynamic Latch, Modified Double Tail 
Dynamic Latch, and StrongARM Latch comparators. By examining the performance of these 
architectures, the aim is to identify which design consumes the least power while maintaining 
effective signal conversion. This research is significant for optimizing ADC functionality 
across various digital applications, from everyday electronics to industrial systems, 
contributing to advancements in digital technology.
# Introduction
Over the last few decades, importance is given to low-power integrated circuits design 
since the power consumption has become a critical issue. Various innovative technologies are 
on to this issue for a better solution, one such solution is proposed here. Almost every electronic 
equipment consists of a Analog to Digital converters, and all the ADCs contain a comparator. 
Reducing the power of the comparator block reduces the power dissipation of ADC, which 
means reducing the power dissipation of the smaller block of the system in turn reduces the 
power dissipation of the overall system.
